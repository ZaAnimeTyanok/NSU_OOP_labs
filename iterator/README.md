## Custom cpp iterator
This is implementation of a simple container and iterator in c++.
A container is a dynamic array that uses a pointer to store data. Container can be initialized using std::initializer_list. Conteiner have push_back and pop_back methods.
Iterator have prefix ++/--, +=, -=, * (depointer), ->, ==, != and = operators.

An example of initializing a container and iterating through elements using an iterator is presented in main function.
